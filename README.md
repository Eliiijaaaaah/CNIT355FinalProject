### How to Install and Configure
   Find and Install the application through the Google Play application store, found using the application name [TBD]
### How to Run and Use
   On application start-up, the user will be presented with live data for the crytpocurrencies currently available for analysis through the application. The user can then select a currency for a more in-depth evaluation, which includes a graph of it's historical prices over a set period, as well as the minimum price, minimum exchange rate, maximum price, and maximum exchange rate reached by that currency. On this page, the user will have access to two labeled buttons, which can return the user to the live data view or update the in-depth analysis. The user can also access an information page through pressing the Info button on the Live Data view, which will explain the purpose of the application, introduce the creators, and show a basic disclaimer denying responsibility for unsuccessful decisions made using our application.
### Design Decisions
This application is made up of three different intents. One intent, LiveDataActivity, consists of two buttons ('Live Data' and 'Info') and a scroll view containing a table displaying information pulled from our API (NOMICS), which will function as buttons to take the user to other activities. While on LiveDataActivity, the Live Data button will be inoperable and colored blue to notify the user of the current activity. Selecting Info will take the user to the InfoActivity intent, which contains two buttons and a number of Text Views explaining the application. In the InfoActivity intent, the Info button will be inoperable and highlighted with a blue background to notify the user of the current activity, while the Live Data button will now take the user back to the LiveDataActivity intent. On the LiveDataActivity Intent, selecting one of the currency data sections generated by NOMICS will take the user to the HistoricalDataActiviy intent, which consists of a graph view displaying currency trends, a number of text views that will be populated with data, and two buttons ('Back to Live Data' and 'Update'). The text views will display the currency type, the minimum price, the minimum exchange rate, the maximum price, and the maximum exchange rate, which will all be retrieved and calculated using NOMICS. The Back to Live Data button will return the user to LiveDataActivity, while the Update button will re-generate the generated data to display current information.
